## Summary

This meeting connected two levels of precarity: immediate living conditions and long-term scientific governance. The opening focused on housing difficulties faced by researchers moving internationally, with concrete examples from relocation experiences and the lack of institutional support. Participants described high costs, low transparency, and dependence on informal networks as recurring barriers.

A concrete action emerged: drafting and circulating a letter to university leadership about accommodation conditions and the contradiction between international recruitment goals and inadequate support systems. The discussion framed housing not as an individual inconvenience but as a structural obstacle that affects who can participate in research and under what conditions.

The second half of the meeting returned to publishing and knowledge infrastructure. Participants discussed building shared digital layers (wiki-style documentation, linked resources, and common tools) that could support decentralized journals and collective editorial practices. The idea was not to replicate legacy publisher structures, but to design infrastructure that communities can own and adapt.

They explored how journals, notes, and community resources might be interconnected so that publication is only one component of a broader knowledge process. This included attention to discoverability, continuity across projects, and reduction of duplicated effort. Naming and domain choices were also discussed as practical steps for identity and public presence.

A pragmatic stance characterized the discussion: even if progress is slow, continuity matters. Rather than wait for perfect institutional conditions, the group prioritized small, testable, cumulative actions. In that sense, this meeting reinforced a working principle that appears repeatedly in later sessions: pair systemic critique with immediate implementation.
