## 1-page summary

This meeting focused on operational method. Building on recent coordination with Marco, participants discussed how Nepero can adopt open-source style collaboration patterns for scientific work and organizational development.

A central analogy was with distributed software projects: shared versioning, branching of contributions, transparent merge processes, and explicit contribution norms. The group considered these mechanisms not as technical details but as social infrastructure that can reduce hierarchy and make collaboration scalable.

From this perspective, publication becomes one output of a longer collective process. Participants explored the possibility of project-based research spaces where contributors can work on different branches, converge when useful, and define authorship criteria in advance. This was framed as a possible antidote to the current model where value is compressed into final papers and individual competition.

The meeting also addressed constraints in funding and institutional recognition. Participants noted that many available funding channels are optimized for startup-like or industrial narratives, which do not map cleanly onto community-led scientific infrastructure. This mismatch remains a strategic obstacle for long-term sustainability.

Despite these challenges, the immediate roadmap was concrete: continue building the resources page, finalize a first coherent website version, revise the manifesto text to remove structural and typographical issues, and prepare communication once the site is ready.

Overall, the session reinforced a practical principle that now recurs across meetings: treat governance, tooling, and writing as one integrated workflow, and prioritize systems that let many people contribute asynchronously without losing coherence.
