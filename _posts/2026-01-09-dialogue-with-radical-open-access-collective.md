## Summary

This meeting was a strategic dialogue with guests connected to the Radical Open Access Collective (ROAC). The conversation traced the genealogy of community-led open publishing from 1990s open-knowledge movements through more recent efforts to build non-commercial support structures for journals and collectives.

Guests emphasized that open access is not a single model but a heterogeneous field shaped by discipline, region, funding context, and labor availability. A key lesson from their experience was that isolated projects struggle to survive; durable progress requires shared infrastructures for documentation, peer support, and exchange of practices.

The group explored how ROAC balances autonomy and coordination among journals. Rather than strict centralization, the model relies on common principles and mutual support while allowing local editorial independence. This directly informed Nepero's own federated-journal vision.

Precarity remained central throughout the discussion. Participants highlighted the contradiction between institutional demands (publish more, secure grants, increase impact) and the instability of academic employment itself. The exchange underscored that complying with mainstream performance metrics does not guarantee long-term security, making alternative collective structures both politically and practically relevant.

Another concrete topic was the gap between providing tools and generating adoption. The group asked why many resources for starting journals exist yet relatively few new journals are created. Responses pointed to time constraints, labor fragmentation, and lack of coordinated onboarding for new groups.

The meeting closed with clear short-term commitments: continue studying existing models, prioritize a first public website version, separate immediate needs (manifesto and newsletter sign-up) from more advanced components (forum), and share work-in-progress more frequently so implementation does not stall.
