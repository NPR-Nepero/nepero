## Summary

This meeting focused on direct manifesto work. Participants reviewed a draft text and discussed tone, argumentative sequence, and political positioning. The core line that emerged is that precarious researchers are central to scientific production but structurally marginalized in decision-making, especially in publication economies dominated by private actors.

A substantial portion of the conversation examined the relationship between publishing and power. The group framed articles not only as outputs but as units that shape legitimacy, funding flows, and career trajectories. From this perspective, control over editorial infrastructures is also control over what kinds of science become visible and rewarded.

The proposed strategic response was to build independent journals and connect them as a network. These journals were not imagined as immediate competitors to large publishers, but as protected niches where different questions, timelines, and collaboration norms can be sustained. Over time, linked niches could influence field-level standards and investment priorities.

Participants also discussed communication style: the manifesto should remain readable and engaging while preserving conceptual precision. There was awareness that an overly abstract text risks losing readers, while an overly tactical text risks losing strategic vision.

The meeting further touched on institutional policy developments affecting precarious workers and the importance of preserving collective knowledge as these frameworks change. Members agreed to continue literature review and documentation work so that political claims are grounded in evidence and historical context.

Overall, this was a consolidation session: less brainstorming, more alignment on a coherent narrative that integrates labor conditions, epistemic goals, and concrete organizational instruments.
