## Summary

This kickoff session established both the political motivation and the practical operating style of the group. Participants described a shared frustration with contemporary academic work: high pressure to publish quickly, little room for exploratory or high-risk ideas, and precarious contracts that force short-term choices. Across different personal trajectories, the same issue emerged: scientific value and career value are often misaligned, and this gap pushes researchers to optimize for metrics rather than knowledge.

A central thread was the need to protect the joy of doing science while still producing work that is visible and legitimate. The group did not present this as a purely idealistic position; instead, members framed it as a strategic challenge. If alternative practices remain private or informal, they risk being invisible. If they become too aligned with standard incentives, they lose their purpose. The discussion therefore moved toward creating a small but durable collective infrastructure that can support experimentation in scientific culture and publishing.

Participants also compared perspectives on what should be changed first: publication systems, collaboration norms, local organizing, and communication tools. Despite differences in emphasis, there was broad agreement that the project should begin with lightweight, low-cost mechanisms that can scale only if they prove useful. The group preferred iterative implementation over a large launch plan.

The meeting closed with a concrete coordination direction. Members discussed setting up a shared communication channel, organizing meetings on a regular biweekly cadence, and keeping a short living record of decisions so that newcomers can onboard quickly. They also considered splitting work into parallel branches (for example: documentation, external mapping of similar initiatives, and publishing experiments) to avoid scattering attention in one large chat.

Overall, this first meeting defined the initiative as both a community and a method: a place to articulate dissatisfaction with current academic structures, and a testbed for alternatives that can be documented, repeated, and eventually reused by others.
