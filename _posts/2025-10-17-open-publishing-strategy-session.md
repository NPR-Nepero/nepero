## 1-page summary

This meeting shifted from general motivation to organizational design. The group discussed how to move from critique of the current publishing system to an implementable model for alternative journals. A key reference point was the ecosystem of radical and community-led open-access initiatives, especially those that provide not only publications but also practical toolkits for creating journals.

A major theme was top-down versus bottom-up reform. Participants argued that policy-level open science mandates often fail to change daily research practice if they are disconnected from communities. In contrast, collective and scholar-led infrastructures can evolve with local needs. The group saw value in learning from existing open publishing organizations while adapting methods to natural and quantitative sciences.

Editorial values were discussed in detail. Rather than optimize for prestige markers, the proposed direction was to evaluate work by contribution, clarity, and relevance to the community. Members emphasized that early-stage or non-mainstream ideas often have no space in high-prestige venues, and that an alternative platform should explicitly protect intellectual diversity and exploratory work.

Another question was architecture: one journal or a federation. The preferred direction was a federated approach where multiple communities can create journals with shared principles and shared technical resources, without forcing all fields into a single editorial board. This allows autonomy at the local level while preserving a common manifesto and governance backbone.

The conversation also addressed institutional and legal constraints. Participants noted that a legal entity may eventually be necessary for formal publication workflows, administration, and long-term sustainability, but agreed to avoid premature bureaucracy before validating the model with concrete outputs.

By the end of the meeting, there was clear momentum around three immediate actions: contact relevant open-access collectives for guidance, continue drafting a common manifesto that defines editorial values, and structure internal workstreams so technical and conceptual tasks can progress in parallel.
