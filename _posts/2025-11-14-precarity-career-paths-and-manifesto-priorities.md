## Summary

This meeting blended personal career updates with strategic editorial work. Participants compared working conditions across national research systems, especially differences between Italy and Spain in funding cycles, contract structures, and opportunities for stabilization. While no system was presented as ideal, the conversation highlighted how institutional design strongly shapes day-to-day precarity.

A recurrent point was uncertainty over future positions despite active applications and strong research profiles. The group discussed the mismatch between official recruitment narratives and actual competition levels, where single calls can attract very large applicant pools. This reinforced the collective diagnosis that precarity is systemic, not an issue of individual performance.

The second major topic was manifesto writing. The group moved from brainstorming to prioritization: not only which concepts should appear, but in what order and with what emphasis. Participants argued that structure matters because the manifesto must communicate quickly to different audiences, including precarious researchers, potential collaborators, and external institutions.

There was discussion on balancing conceptual depth with accessibility. Instead of a long theoretical document, they leaned toward concise framing anchored in a few high-priority principles. The goal was to make the text usable as an organizing tool, not only a statement of intent.

Operationally, the meeting also served to synchronize timelines for the next sessions around travel constraints and availability. The immediate outcome was a clearer drafting approach: identify core concepts first, then refine wording and order so each paragraph advances a coherent political and practical narrative.
