## Summary

This session brought the manifesto process into a more explicit drafting phase. Alongside personal updates about postdoc transitions and hiring dynamics, participants focused on how the collective should define itself publicly and what common ground can unite researchers across disciplines and institutional contexts.

A key shift in discussion was from motivations to representation. Rather than centering only on individual reasons for doing science, the group emphasized shared labor conditions: temporary contracts, weak institutional voice, and fragmented career trajectories. This framing was seen as more politically actionable and more inclusive for building alliances beyond a single field.

Participants noted that over-competition and metric pressure remain central problems, but argued that a manifesto gains strength when it connects those epistemic issues to workplace realities. In this view, publication reform, research culture, and labor organization are inseparable.

The group also discussed scope discipline for the text. There was consensus that the first manifesto version should be short and operational, roughly one to two pages, with additional details moved into later addenda. This would allow faster publication, easier collective editing, and clearer external communication.

Another practical topic was meeting participation and timing. The group acknowledged uneven attendance and tried to keep decisions robust even when not all members are present, while leaving room for asynchronous contributions.

The session ended with a concrete drafting plan: compile a summary draft from existing notes, prioritize clarity over completeness, and circulate a first compact version that can function immediately as a public reference point for the initiative.
