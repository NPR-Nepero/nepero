## Summary

This meeting started with practical updates from relocation and quickly moved to publishing governance after a high-profile conference review-management incident. Participants discussed how a breakdown in anonymity and process integrity can invalidate weeks of labor by authors and reviewers, especially in large-scale conference systems.

The incident was treated as more than a technical bug: it was used to examine fragility in current peer-review architectures, asymmetries of power in emergency decisions, and the human cost of unstable workflows. The group compared blind-review and open-review models, not as abstract principles but as governance systems with concrete tradeoffs in accountability, transparency, and risk.

From that critique, the conversation returned to constructive design. Members revisited the plan for a collective website with a manifesto, practical documentation, and a pathway for communities to start journals locally. The central idea remained a minimal but reusable method: shared technical knowledge, clear governance assumptions, and adaptable templates rather than a single centralized platform.

Participants also clarified near-term contributions. Work was distributed across tasks such as wiki drafting, static-site support, naming proposals, and integration of feedback on existing documents. The working norm was to keep contributions lightweight and frequent so that progress does not depend on long isolated work cycles.

By the end of the session, the direction was clear: continue using current publishing failures as empirical evidence for why alternatives are needed, while simultaneously building the first version of those alternatives through iterative documentation and collaborative implementation.
