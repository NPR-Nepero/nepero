## Summary

This session opened with a broad reflection on geopolitical instability and its immediate effects on researchers' lives, mobility, and emotional bandwidth. Participants discussed how international crises and state violence reshape both personal trajectories and the practical conditions of academic work.

The conversation then moved to the local consequences of systemic uncertainty: irregular career horizons, intense competition for limited calls, and difficulty planning medium-term work. The group framed precarity as a layered condition in which global events amplify already fragile institutional environments.

After this contextual framing, the meeting turned to implementation. Members reviewed what the Nepero website should contain in its first functional version, including manifesto content and a practical section on how communities can start a journal. The emphasis remained on actionable guidance rather than symbolic communication.

There was also discussion of formalization: whether and when to create an association, what minimum legal requirements might apply, and the need for legal advice from people with direct experience in nonprofit or cultural organizations. Participants agreed that legal structure can increase continuity and legitimacy, but should not delay immediate organizing work.

The session ended by identifying legal and organizational questions as priority follow-ups for the next meeting. In parallel, members committed to keep advancing public-facing materials so that the initiative remains visible and usable while governance details are clarified.
