## NEPERO Manifesto: reclaim science from the bottom

We are a precarious researchers.

We move. We restart. We adapt.
And because we move, we are rarely allowed to decide.

Yet without our work, research would not function. The majority of experiments, calculations, writing, reviewing, and teaching is done by people on temporary contracts. This contradiction is structural. It is not a personal failure. And it will not resolve itself.

### Why we exist

We are NEPERO, an association of precarious researchers who refuse to remain invisible while keeping the system alive.

We want a concrete way to exist **as researchers**, not just as replaceable labor. We want tools that let us act together, not just survive. We start from where science stems: **how knowledge is published, shared, and made legitimate**.

This is why NEPERO is also an editorial initiative. The current publishing system has deep limitations that shape how science is currently getting done.

### The core idea: publishing is power

In science, the main product is the article.

The economy of articles—what counts, what circulates, what attracts funding—is controlled largely by private, profit-oriented publishers.  
But the work of writing, reviewing, and editing articles is done mostly by **precarious researchers**.

That imbalance is the lever.

Our main instrument of independence—scientific, economic, and eventually political—is to create **independent journals**, and to **coordinate them**.

### How change can happen

These journals are not meant to compete with profit-driven ones at the start.

Their objective is to create **niches**.

Places where different questions can be asked.   
Where unfinished ideas are allowed to exist.  
Where collaboration replaces racing.  

Niches attract people. Connected niches reshape fields. Over time, this influences how science is valued—and where economic investment flows.

That is how bottom-up change works.

### What we envision

We are building an **organization of organizations**: a framework that others can copy and use.

- **Independent journals (plural)**  
If you agree with the manifesto, you can launch a **non-profit** journal using a shared “how-to” guide and a minimal ethical commitment.

- **A hub that connects them**  
It starts as a public list of journals. It grows into a network where journals share practices, cross-reference work, and coordinate while staying autonomous.

- **Open access, real publishing**  
Each journal aims for strong open-access features while staying inside standard scholarly infrastructure: stable archiving, clear editorial responsibility, and **ISSN** for the journal and **DOIs** for published items.

- **Formats that grow collaboration**  
Journals publish multiple citable formats (questions/proposals, partial results, responses, updates). Everything stays traceable, so early ideas can safely grow into collaborations and joint papers.

### First steps and where we’re going

#### Ongoing effort:

- launch a public website
- send a regular newsletter
- connect with other associations
- create the first journal

#### We keep a steady rhythm:

- meetings every two weeks (open to all)
- written summaries for those who can’t attend
- working groups that produce specific outputs

### Join us at NEPERO

If you are precarious and done waiting for permission, take control with us: build a network of independent journals that changes how science is done.

This is construction—bottom-up work by the people who already keep science running, now choosing to shape its future.
