## Precarity in academia

### Who we are

The main obstacle in defining precarious work in higher education and research is the diversity of its forms in different countries, domain of research and even institutions,[^akerlind2005] [^eua2024report] and the resulting lack of aggregated data worldwide.[^oecd2021reducing]

### How we got here

Although the trajectory of precarious employment in academia has varied across countries, the majority of studies report a pronounced increase in postdoctoral positions during the second half of the twentieth century, following earlier implementations in the United States[^mervis1999science] and United Kingdom.[^wikiJRF]

**United States.** Traditionally rooted in the Old-European guild system (Master, Apprentice and Journeymen), in the United States the postdoctoral scholarship started taking its current form following World War II, driven by the scientific domain, deemed at the time as integral to national defense interests.[^micoli2018history]

**France.** The postdoctoral scolarship was introduced in French academia much later than the above cases, given that, even in 1999, the country was maintaining "a 3-decade-old policy that says it would be unfair to offer people temporary posts with no promise of permanent employment".[^balter1999europe]
